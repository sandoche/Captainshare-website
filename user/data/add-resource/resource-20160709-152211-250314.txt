description: thangs is an iOS and Android app which simplifies and encourages the lending and borrowing of everyday objects between friends e.g. objects like a drill or sports equipment like a surfboard, but there are no limits. With friends we mean your address book contacts, the people you exchanged your mobile phone number with. With thangs it is easy to ask them for a product you would like to borrow. The simple interface allows you to answer incoming requests with only one tap. No more action required to help your friends in the first place, just one simple tap on a yes or no button. Afterwards communication about time and place for the exchange can happen. And because giving things back on time is always a huge issue, we’ve integrated the lend list. This list helps you to keep track of all the things you&#039;ve shared. Because there&#039;s nothing more painful than to run after your shared stuff.
